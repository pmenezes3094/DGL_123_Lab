   Summary
   
   1. Readability:
      - Avoid confusing language constructs.
      - Adhere to a consistent coding style.
   2. Performance:
      - Detect performance anti-patterns using static code analysis.
      - Examples include optimizing code inside loops and identifying concurrency problems.
   3. Reliability:
      - Detect reliability issues within individual components through static analysis.
      - Examples include identifying data race conditions, null pointer exceptions, and improper exception handling.
   4. Security:
      - Automated static scanning can detect security weaknesses.
      - Examples include finding weak cryptography, insecure framework configurations, and hard-coded security tokens.
   5. Dependency Management:
      - Consider third-party dependencies carefully.
      - Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to monitor and identify security issues in dependencies.
      - SCA can detect security vulnerabilities, attacks on open source repositories, and backdoors injected by malicious committers.

   Summary
   
 1. Consistent Coding Style:
    - Follow a consistent coding style for readability.
    - Include indentation,proper naming,whitespace,comments etc.
      
 2. Strict Data Types:
    - Explicitly specify the data types to clarify variable data types.
         
 3. Avoid Global Variables:
    - Minimize the use of global variables to prevent scope and naming conflicts.
        
 4. Use an Autoloader:
    - Implement an autoloader to include necessary files automatically.
      
 5. Avoid Short Tags:
    - Always use standard PHP tags (<?php and ?>) to ensure compatibility across different environments.
      
 6. Version Control System:
    - Utilize a version control system like Git to track and manage code changes.
      
 7. Use a Framework:
    - Consider using a PHP framework (e.g., Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter) for structured development.
      
 8. Security Measures:
    - Keep security in mind to protect against common threats like SQL injection.
      
 9. Stay Updated:
    - Continuously update your knowledge of PHP features, libraries, and best practices.

## Self Evaluation

4/4

Initially, we started collaborating via email and later moved on to using GitHub. we did face some challenges while collaborating via git as we had conflicting updates and had to resolve issues multiple times before we created our final file. we therefore are quite satisfied with our efforts in learning and contributing in this collaborative environment and therefore we mark our efforts as 4 on a 4-point scale.
